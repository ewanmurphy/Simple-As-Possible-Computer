* DESCRPTION :
The RAM is a 16x8 static TTL RAM. You can program the RAM by means of the address and dta switch registers. This allows you to store a program and data in the memory before a computer run. During a computer run, the RAM receives 4-bit addressed form the MAR and a read operation is performed. In this way, the instruction or data word stored in the RAM is placed on the W bus for use in some other part of the computer.
