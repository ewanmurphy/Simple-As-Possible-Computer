* DESCRPTION :
The instruction register is part of the control unit. To fetch an instruction from the memory the computer does a memory read operation. This palces the contents of the addressed memory location on the W bus. At the same time, the instruction register is set up for loading on the next positive clock edge.
The contents of the instruction register are split into two nibbles. The upper nibble is a two-state output that goes directly to the Controller Sequencer. The lower nibble is a three-state output that is read onto the W bus when needed.
