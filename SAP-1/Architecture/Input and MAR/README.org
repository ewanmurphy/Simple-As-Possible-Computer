* DESCRPTION :
The Input and MAR block includes the address and data switch registers. These switch registers, whare are part of the input unit, allow you to send 4 address bits and 8 data bits to the RAM. Instruction and data words need to be written into the RAM before the computer can run.
The memory address register (MAR) is part of the SAP-1 memory. During a computer run, the address in the program counter is latched into the MAR. A bit later, the MAR applied this 4-bit address to the RAM, where a read operation is performed.
